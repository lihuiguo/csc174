### The Three Retailers

Three of the most popular clothing retailers in the U.S. today are **American Eagle**, **H&M**, and **Urban Outfitters**. Each sells a wide range of items - women's clothing, men's clothing, accessories, shoes, and home goods. However, their most popular section is women's clothing and so, women comprise of much of their market. These retailers are often found in malls and popular shopping streets. They target a younger demographic, around 18-24 year olds, with their clothing. They are successful both within the U.S. and globally. 

### American Eagle

#### History

American Eagle's beginning was with the Silverman family, which owned and operated Silvermans Menswear. By the mid-1970s, two of the Silverman brothers—from the third generation of Silvermans in the family business—were running the family business. Jerry Silverman was the president and CEO, while his brother, Mark Silverman, served as executive vice-president and COO. The Silverman brothers were convinced they needed to diversify their product offerings in order to continue growing their company. They also recognized that the addition of new family-owned chains would then enable them to operate more than one store in the same mall. Their first attempt was to open American Eagle Outfitters in 1977, positioning it as a proprietor of brand-name leisure apparel, footwear, as well as accessories for men and women, emphasizing merchandise suited for outdoor sports, such as hiking, mountain climbing, and camping. Stores were set up in shopping malls and a catalog was established. The chain grew for much of the 1980s. In 1989, the owners decided to refocus their business on American Eagle Outfitters, selling their other retail chains. At that time, there were 137 American Eagle Outfitters stores in 36 different states.

#### Brand Style

Items are placed on wooden shelving, tables, or clothes racks. The clothes in low-volume stores are hung on basic black hangers, and higher-volume stores have wooden hangers. There is usually a flat screen television hanging in the back of the store or behind the cash wrap. The floors are typically wood or concrete. The theme and displays change based on seasonal lines and promotions.


### H&M

#### History

The company was founded by Erling Persson in 1947, when he opened his first shop in Västerås, Sweden. The shop, called Hennes (Swedish for "hers"), exclusively sold women's clothing. A store was opened in Norway in 1964. In 1968, Persson acquired the hunting apparel retailer Mauritz Widforss, which led to the inclusion of a menswear collection in the product range and the name change to Hennes & Mauritz.

The company was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1974. Shortly after, in 1976, the first store outside Scandinavia opened in London. H&M continued to expand in Europe, and began to retail online in 1998, when it was able to buy the domain hm.com from a company called A1 in a non-published domain transaction. The two-letter domain was registered in the early 1990s, but data on the first registration is lost. The opening of the first U.S. store on March 31, 2000, on Fifth Avenue in New York marked the start of the expansion outside of Europe.

#### Brand Style

In addition to the H&M brand, the company consists of five individual brands with separate concepts.

One of them, COS launched its flagship store on London’s Regent Street in March 2007 with a catwalk show at the Royal Academy. Its concept is encompassed by minimalist style inspired by architecture, graphics, and design. It specialises in modern clothing pieces for men and women that are less trend-oriented than other similarly priced labels. COS makes clothing that can be worn beyond the season. COS has 197 stores in 34 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, Australia and the Middle East and currently retails online to 19 markets via cosstores.com.


### Urban Outfitters

#### History

The company was founded in 1970 as the retail store Free People by Richard Hayne, Judy Wicks, and Scott Belair in 1970 as a project for an entrepreneurship class at University of Pennsylvania. It was renamed to Urban Outfitters and incorporated in 1976. Urban Outfitters, Inc (URBN) carries multiple stores within the URBN portfolio of brands, which also includes Anthropologie, Free People, Terrain, BHLDN, and The Ventri Group.

#### Brand Style

Urban Outfitters has been described as hipster, mall punk, stylish, kitschy, irreverent, bohemian, and retro. It carries sometimes odd merchandise, for example, T-shirts emblazoned with the words “Jive Turkey” or “Atari”. They are known for catering to “hipster” culture and fashion, which incorporates influences from past decades. In house brands include Kimchi Blue, BDG (Bulldog), Pins & Needles, Sparkle & Fade, Silence + Noise, iets frans, Coincidence & Chance, Deena & Ozzy, Ecote and Staring at Stars.
